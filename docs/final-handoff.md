# Project Pulse Final Handoff

## Overview

Mona's Project Pulse dashboard is implemented as a responsive static frontend. The team used GitHub Copilot CLI in a Codespace to coordinate four custom agents:

- **Orchestrator** coordinated the work, delegated file ownership, integrated the results, and reviewed the final dashboard.
- **Planner** researched the repository requirements and created the implementation plan in `docs/project-pulse-plan.md`.
- **Designer** made the visual and accessibility decisions and created the polished responsive styling.
- **Coder** implemented the dashboard structure, project data, and launch configuration.

The complete agent team is **Orchestrator, Planner, Designer, and Coder**.

## Delivered files

- `app/index.html` contains the semantic dashboard structure, the exact `Project Pulse` title, references `styles.css` and `project-data.json`, and renders visible `.project-card` elements from the loaded projects data.
- `app/styles.css` contains the responsive visual system, including `.dashboard` and `.project-card` selectors, rounded surfaces, shadows, status treatments, priority treatments, focus states, and reduced-motion support.
- `app/project-data.json` contains a valid top-level `projects` array with four representative records. Each record includes `name`, `owner`, `status`, `recentActivity`, `priority`, and a contributor-friendly `summary`.
- `.vscode/launch.json` contains the strict JSON launch configuration named **Run Project Pulse Dashboard**. It runs `python3 -m http.server 5500` from `${workspaceFolder}/app` and opens `http://localhost:%s/index.html`.

## validation

The final dashboard was checked against the implementation plan and the requested acceptance criteria:

- Confirmed the exact HTML title is `Project Pulse`.
- Confirmed `app/index.html` links to `styles.css` and references `project-data.json`.
- Confirmed the page fetches project data and renders cards using the `project-card` class.
- Confirmed the UI displays each project's status, recent activity, priority, owner, and summary.
- Confirmed `app/styles.css` includes `.dashboard`, `.project-card`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, responsive breakpoints, visible focus styling, and accessible text-based status treatments.
- Parsed `app/project-data.json` successfully and confirmed its top-level `projects` key and required fields on every project.
- Parsed `.vscode/launch.json` successfully as strict JSON and confirmed **Run Project Pulse Dashboard**, the required Python server command, the app working directory, and the dashboard URL.
- Served the `app/` directory with the configured HTTP server and confirmed the dashboard entry point opens at `index.html` rather than a directory listing.

## handoff

The final Project Pulse result is a polished, responsive dashboard with data-driven project cards, accessible status and priority treatments, and a repeatable local launch workflow. The generated app files are `app/index.html`, `app/styles.css`, and `app/project-data.json`. The launch file is `.vscode/launch.json`, and its **Run Project Pulse Dashboard** configuration runs the Project Pulse dashboard directly at `http://localhost:%s/index.html`, not a directory listing.

### Future steps and limitations

- Future steps may include adding filtering, sorting, search, aggregate status metrics, and a connection to live project data.
- The current dashboard is a static frontend backed by local JSON; it has no persistence, authentication, or live data synchronization.
- Before adding new features, confirm the data schema and preserve the current Designer/Coder file ownership boundaries.
- The learner should start the dashboard through **Run Project Pulse Dashboard** so the browser can load `project-data.json` over HTTP.
